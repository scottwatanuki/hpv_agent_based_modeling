Figure 1 — Baseline prevalence over time (coverage=0.7, efficacy=0.9, steps=120).
- Description: Prevalence trajectory from a single seeded infection in a population of N=1000 under random mixing. Vaccine efficacy reduces susceptibility among vaccinated agents; infections may clear each timestep with probability 0.05.
- Parameters: β=0.02, clearance_prob=0.05, partners_per_step=5, seed=42 (baseline).
